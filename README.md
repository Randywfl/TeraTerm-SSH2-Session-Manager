TeraTerm is a Fine SSH Client for general professional use.  The main weakness is lacking the abiliy to save your sessions as you go.  There is a Very lame "menu" companion app that I was never able to get working so
I decided to create my own session manager. It is somewhat limited in that it only wworks for SSH sessions, but that is all I needed.   I may eventually post the source code if someone insists they need it
to include telnet.
This manager was written using PureBasic ver 5.40 specifically to work with TeraTerm v5.5 and I don't anticipate I will provide any updates here when TT releases any subsequent updates.
Password feature only keeps the pswd for you in each respective session.  The pasasword is posted to your clipboard when you click [Connect].  Best I could do since Tera Term does not allow credentials to be passed to the client.
